                                <span>The FSC held a meeting with the relevant institutions to review financial market risks on January 27 chaired by Secretary General Lee Se-Hoon. At the meeting, Secretary General Lee stated that even though the Feds recent announcement was largely in line with market expectations, U.S. stocks fell and the stock market volatility is continuing in domestic markets as the Fed Chairmans press announcement was taken to be hawkish. Secretary General Lee said that financial market volatility appears to be unavoidable for some time due to a number of different factorssuch as the accelerated pace of tightening in the U.S., spread of the omicron variant, slowdown in Chinas economic growth and the Russia-Ukraine conflictand that it is necessary to closely monitor markets to prevent market anxiety from spreading excessively when exports and growth indicators are standing strong. The meeting also discussed potential impact of market volatilities on the household and corporate debt situations as well as on financial companies and looked into measures to minimize negative effects. Amid recent volatility in equity markets, the FSC has raised the market monitoring level to caution on January 25. The authorities will continue to closely monitor financial market conditions at home and abroad to check potential risk factors. * Please refer to the attached PDF for details.</span>

                                <span>The FSC announced that the Financial Development Review Committee held a general meeting on January 25 to discuss recent market conditions and key policy measures for this year. The 2022 FDRC is made up of 49 financial market experts of which 21 of them are newly appointed. The FSC will regularly seek policy advice from the FDRC as the authorities draw up and implement financial policies for 2022. The following is a summary of Chairman Kohs keynote address. Chairmans Remarks (2021 Financial Policy) 2021 was the year that required acute balancing acts in many respects. First, the household debt management plan introduced in October 2021 focused on enhancing control over the total household debt amount. It has helped to bring down the speed of the debt growth to a steady level. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 financial support programs through the KRW175 trillion-plus support packages, loan maturity extensions and payment deferrals for small businesses have provided reliefs to the lower income and vulnerable groups. Amid a rapid transition to digitalization in the financial industry, the FSC has promoted innovation and competition in the financial industry while ensuring stability in the markets and guaranteeing consumer protections. (2022 Economic and Financial Market Condition) The financial industry is facing uncertainty and volatility from the onset of 2022. While the economy is on a recovery track, there are threats to the economy such as the spread of the omicron variant and Chinas growth slowdown. Deepening financial imbalances around the world have exposed potential risk factors. The earlier-than-expected global tapering moves will lead to the end of the easy liquidity environment. The financial landscape is rapidly changing as more convergence and collaboration take place with big tech and fintech companies. As such, there will be growing demand for more public trust and fairness in the financial system. (2022 Financial Policy Tasks) The FSCs policy initiatives for 2</span>

The consultative body made up of officials from the relevant government and regulatory agencies, research institution and industry groups was established to refine the complementary function of indemnity health insurance offered by the private sector and guarantee its sustainability alongside the state-operated National Health Insurance (NHI) program. At the kick-off meeting, officials discussed the following issues and areas where improvements can be made. a) Sustainability issue related to the insurance premium hikes and cost burdens on the insured, excessive medical treatments and nonessential hospital visits, etc. b) Convenience issue related to the complicated offline insurance claims process c) Complementariness issue concerning the relationship with the state-operated NHI system particularly in the area of out-of-pocket expenses (copayments) d) Transition issue as the indemnity health insurance 4.0 became available from July 2021 Starting from the end of January, the FSC will set up working level groups with industry officials and experts to discuss and look into detailed areas where improvements can be made to the indemnity health insurance system. The FSC will continue to closely coordinate with the relevant ministries to help reduce costs for insurance and medical services. * Please refer to the attache PDF for details.</span>

                                <span>FSC Chairman Koh Seungbeom held a meeting with officials from the Bank of Korea, Financial Supervisory Service, research institutions and local banks on January 19 to check business conditions of small-scale businesses and their debt risks as the loan maturity extension and payment deferment program is set to expire at the end of March 2022.The following is a summary of Chairman Kohs keynote address. Chairmans Remarks Self-employed small businesses make up about 87 percent of all businesses and 21 percent of economically active population in Korea. However, these businesses have suffered greatly in the past two years amid the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The financial sector has provided them with loan maturity extensions and deferment on interest payments and it has helped to ease small merchants payment burdens on some KRW272.2 trillion worth of business loans between April 2020 and November 2021. In addition, the small merchant lending support programs made available low interest rate busines loans to those facing liquidity problems. From the end of this month, adjustments made to the card processing fee rates will also help ease small merchants fee burdens.The prolonged pandemic situation, however, has raised concerns about a spread of potential risks to the financial system. For the past two years, the speed of debt growth for the self-employed has exceeded that of the household sector. An accumulation of bad debts can threaten stability in the financial system. In particular, delays in business recovery coupled with interest rate hikes can lead to a credit crunch and pose greater problems for small businesses. The loan maturity extensions and payment deferments for small merchants and SMEs are set to expire at the end of March 2022. Although it is difficult to predict events two months ahead, it is certain that there will be contradictory policy tasks between ensuring the risk handling capacity of small businesses and strengthening risk management in the financia</span>

                                <span>The FSC and the Ministry of SMEs and Startups announced the availability of KRW8.6 trillion worth of low interest rate business loans for small merchants whose business operations have been hit by the prolonged COVID-19 social distancing measures. The lending support which will be available from January 24 aims to provide relief to some 860,000 small scale businesses that have been hit by the pandemic distancing measures and received assistance through the governments loss recovery fund from the end of last year. The total size of the low interest rate lending support program is KRW10 trillion funded by the governments fiscal expenditure. Small scale businesses that have experiences setbacks from the prolonged COVID-19 social distancing measures can apply to receive up to KRW10 million each at an interest rate between 1 percent and 1.5 percent based on their credit standing starting from January 24. Applicants with low credit scores can apply for loans through the Small Enterprise and Market Service (SEMAS). Those with mid-range credit scores between 745 and 919 can apply for loans with special guarantees from local credit guarantee foundations. Small merchants with credit scores of 920 or above can apply through local banks. Application will be available via mobile apps from local banks to help speed up the lending process. * Please refer to the attached PDF for details.</span>
